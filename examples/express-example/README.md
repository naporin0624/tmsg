# tmsg express example

This repo shows how to use `@tmsg/runtime` and `@tmsg/x` to manage translations in an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) project.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/?lang=de` for the German translation, and `http://localhost:8080/?lang=en` for the English one.
The default translation is English.
